# Workflow Debug Trace for Avenue Connections Request

## Problem Analysis

The request "search for Avenue Connections info and send to willianschelles@gmail.com" is being classified as complex but not executing properly.

## Current Flow Analysis

1. **Request Classification** (in `is_complex_request?`):
   - Request: "search for Avenue Connections info and send to willianschelles@gmail.com"
   - Contains " and " → classified as `multi_step` → `is_complex = true`
   - ✅ CORRECT: This should be complex

2. **Workflow Handling** (in `handle_workflow_request`):
   - Tries `SimpleWorkflowEngine.handle_email_calendar_request` first
   - This returns `{:not_email_calendar_workflow, request}` because it's not an email→calendar workflow
   - Falls back to `WorkflowEngine.create_and_execute_workflow`

3. **WorkflowEngine.create_and_execute_workflow**:
   - Calls `analyze_request_complexity` with OpenAI to understand the request
   - Should return `{:complex_workflow, workflow_context}`
   - Creates a task via `TaskManager.create_task`
   - Calls `execute_workflow` to start execution

4. **Workflow Execution Issues**:
   - The workflow breaks down the request into steps using OpenAI
   - Each step should be executed using `ToolCalling.ask_with_tools`
   - **PROBLEM**: The steps aren't being executed properly with tools

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in the **format_workflow_result** function in ToolCalling.ex:

```elixir
defp format_workflow_result(result, is_new_workflow) do
  case result do
    %{message: message, details: details} -> # Proper workflow result
      # ... handles this correctly
    %{message: message} -> # Simple message result
      # ... handles this correctly  
    _ -> # FALLBACK CASE - THIS IS THE PROBLEM
      {:ok, %{
        response: "Workflow completed successfully", # Generic message
        tools_used: [],                              # No tools executed
        context_used: [],                           # No context used
        task: nil,
        metadata: %{workflow_completed: true, raw_result: result}
      }}
  end
end
```

## What Should Happen

1. **Search Phase**: Use RAG/vector search to find Avenue Connections information
2. **Email Composition**: Use found information to compose email
3. **Email Sending**: Use EmailTool to send email to willianschelles@gmail.com

## Current Problems

1. The workflow execution doesn't properly handle the search + email use case
2. The workflow steps aren't calling the right tools
3. The `format_workflow_result` fallback is masking execution failures
4. No actual tool execution is happening

## Solution Areas

1. **Fix WorkflowEngine step execution**: Ensure steps actually call tools
2. **Fix format_workflow_result**: Better error handling instead of generic success
3. **Add proper search+email workflow**: Handle this common pattern explicitly
4. **Improve debugging**: Log what's actually happening in each step
